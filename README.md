# Numerical Analysis

Euler: Initial Value problems for Ordinary Differential Equations

Fibonacii: simple code that uses bisection to get fibonacii values

Final: code from the final take home test, things like using Newton's methodto solve initial value problems and Midpoint Polynomial Interpolation

Interpgui: Demonstrates interpolation by a piecewise linear interpolant, a polynomial spline, and a shape preserving Hermite Cubic (most of the code was already provided)

NumDiffandInt: Numerical differentiation and integration, implementations of composite simpsons rule and Integral approximation using cubic splines

OneVarEqnSolver: One variable equation solver, newbis: finds the zero of a function using Newtons method and bisection when Newton's method fails

PolyEval: Polynomial Interpolation, cubic splines implementation, Integral approximation using polynomial interpolation and cubic splines interpolation, interpNewton: Newton's divided difference formula to calculate the coefficients of the interpolating polynomial
